				“<span class="kofuku">Kofuku</span> makes the most delish kueh lapis way better than the popular chain store! I’m very fussy 
		about my kueh lapis and I’ve tried many variations homemade to commercial ones from Singapore 
		and Indonesia. The quality and consistency in taste, texture, colour and layering are indications of a 
		good lapis. And <span class="kofuku">Kofuku</span> has got all the checks marked!”

		"The golden cookies I ate were one of the best I have tasted; the handy bite-sized, melt-in-your-
		mouth yummy cookies were not only good, the sweetness was just right. My 15-year-old niece and 
		myself polished off the entire box of cookies in one sitting before the CNY rolled around...we are 
		definitely looking forward to eating them again soon..."

		“I am a huge fan of their cakes and pastries and have never hesitated to try their new stuff as I know 
		they will never disappoint. The cranberry yogurt and soufflé rolls are light to the taste but have a 
		delicious aroma which ensures that you will unconsciously end up eating more than expected.
		The Kueh Lapis is simply to-die-for! The lapis seasoning flavour is distinct without being 
		overwhelming. The cake is moist and super buttery but not cloying. This is another offering where 
		one simply cannot stop partaking of the cake until it is all gone!”

		“This is THE kueh lapis that fully satisfy our picky tastebuds! Not only the taste, the quality is also 
		better than those in big chain bakery. Try their prune lapis as well. <span class="kofuku">Kofuku</span> is generous in quantity of 
		fillings. One is never enough.”

				“I love all kinds of cookies and cakes. However, never have I expected <span class="kofuku">Kofuku</span> to produce such 
				quality and yummylicious range within such a short period of time. Keep up the good work and 
				certainly I wait in anticipation for more innovations from the heart!”
